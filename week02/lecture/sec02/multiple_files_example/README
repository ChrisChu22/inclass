This is a basic example of a C program with multiple files.

In general, when you break up a C program into multiple file you put
related functions into separate .c files. For each .c file you also
create a .h file. For example:

foo.h
foo.c

The foo.h will have any data types (enums, structs, etc.),
macros (#define ...), and function prototypes (int foo(int x, int y);).

You will include foo.h

#include "foo.h"

(Note the quotes "foo.h" means to look in the current directory).

in foo.c and any other .c file that uses functions and datatypes from
foo.h and foo.c.

So, if main.c uses foo.c functions, it will include foo.h.

A convention that is used to prevent including a .h file more than once
is to put the following in each .h file:

#ifndef _FOO_H
#define _FOO_H

/* put foo.h declarations here */

#endif /* _FOO_H */
